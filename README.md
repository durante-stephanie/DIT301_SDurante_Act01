##1. What challenges did you face installing Andriod Studio?
- Installing Android Studio was a bit confusing because it took a long time to download and set up. The emulator didnâ€™t work at first, so I had to fix some settings before I could run the app.

##2. What did you learn about Android app structure?
- I learned that Android apps have different parts like the layout for the screen and the code that controls what the app does.
